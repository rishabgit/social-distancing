## WIP 

Since CCTVs have the high ground ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) simply comparing the distances between the centroids should tell us if people are social distancing or not.

# To-do:  
* Implement some object tracking method. Tracking multiple objects using KCF is VERY slow.
* Clean the code.
* Train a better model for this use-case.  
... will add more when I think of them
